### This code demonstrates proficiency in the following Python concepts:

• **Random number generation**: Utilizing randint from the random module.

• **User input**: Retrieving player name and setting the desired range.

• **Conditional statements**: Employing if, elif, and while statements for game logic.

• **Loops**: Utilizing a while loop to keep asking for guesses until the correct number is found.

• **File I/O**: Reading and writing the high score to a file using open.

### Improvements over the previous version:

• **Customization**: The addition of a customizable range enhances player control and caters to different skill levels.

This code showcases a well-structured and engaging number guessing game with high score tracking. It builds upon the previous version by offering player customization and demonstrates your ability to adapt and improve your code.

### Further Enhancements:

• **Error handling**: Implement error handling to gracefully address invalid user inputs.

• **Visuals**: Consider adding a graphical user interface (GUI) for a more visually appealing experience.
